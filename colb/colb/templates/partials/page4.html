        We’re part of a new market, only ten years old. Look at the blockchain’s
        potential: cryptocurrencies alone have already averaged more profitable
        growth than other categories of investment. Diverse areas of economics
        relative to the blockchain remain to be implemented, among them the
        inclusion of technology to define the origin of products in the
        production chain, including asset and commodity tokenization.

        Ventures which demonstrate solid fundamentals and outstanding
        possibilities are today actively entering the market. However, there is
        still space for the category to better establish itself. This represents
        our opportunity to play a serious role in blockchain’s evolution.
